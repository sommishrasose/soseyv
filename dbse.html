                Most assessment systems evaluate students solely based on a semester-end, marks-based examination. This
                puts a lot of emphasis on learning by rote and memorizing textbooks. It also has very strict rules about
                which subjects can be studied and how exams are set up. High-stakes board exams have become a source of
                extreme stress for many students, also adversely impacting their wellbeing.
                <br>
                <br>
                There is barely any focus on making assessment a regular part of the teaching-learning experience and
                using assessments as tools for learning rather than solely to evaluate student progress. Carefully
                designed assessments can help students improve their practical, creative, analytical, and
                problem-solving skills.
                <br>
                <br>
                With this context in place, the Delhi Government started the Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE). The
                DBSE advocates for a new assessment system that enables students' holistic development. It aims to shift
                the focus of assessment and prepare students for future challenges in a stress-free environment.
                Supplemented with the cutting-edge curricula of ASOSEs , students will be prepared to pursue higher
                education in premier institutions as well as the new-age employment opportunities of the 21st century.
                <br>
                <br>
                DBSE is recognised by the Ministry of Education, Government of India and is at par with Central Board of
                Secondary Education (CBSE) and other state boards.
